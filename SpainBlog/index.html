            <div class="intro">
                <p>Hi travel buddies!  The title’s no joke. My pal told me I should visit Alhambra in Granada, Spain. I’d never been to that country, so I was going in fresh. After my trip, I couldn’t be happier to say that I would recommend any who reads this.</p>

            <div class="advice">
                <p>Spain is one of the most intriguing countries, known for its food, wine, dancing and bullfighting, but I can assure you that there is much more to it. It is the Fourth largest country in Europe, owing up to a population of over 47 million. The historical attractions really peaked my interest. Although I may recount visiting cities, the rural and smaller areas are even more of a hidden gem.</p>

                <h2>ADVICE</h2>
                <p>Here’s some safety advice I received from my pal over in Spain for any of you guys who are interested in travelling there:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Check up on the COVID-19 updates for Spain.</li>
                        <li>Avoid empty public spaces (who knows who’s lurking there).</li>
                        <li>Brush on those common spanish phrases.</li>
                        <li>Watch out! There are plenty of petty crimes being committed. Don’t keep your values in one place and guard your belongings – passport, money, and values!</li>
                        <li>Make sure your chosen accommodations are safe and reliable before booking.</li>
                        <li>Bank up on Euros.</li>
                    </ul>

                <h2>GETTING THERE</h2>
                <p>After gaining more information before travelling, I decided to go during early fall since that was the best time of the year to go and visit, being much cooler and where winter starts to poke around. Although I had only 14 days, I didn’t neglect even one to show you all its beauty. So…I chose to travel around the country! The travel rules weren’t as harsh as they were a year or two ago – ha ha…Though we still had to wear masks during public transport.</p>

            <div>
                <h2>BARCELONA</h2>
                <p>Our first stop was in Barcelona. Both seaport and capital, this place are magical in its Art Nouveau architecture and stained glass.</p>
                <h3>LA SAGRADA FAMILIA</h3>
                <p>La Sagrada Familia is probably the most famous landmark, measuring 172 meters high! The Basilica is peculiar being that it is encircled by more industrialist and tame architecture but goes to show how creativity towers over. It was commissioned in 1882 with Antoni Gaudi as the lead architect who was renowned as a genius in his field, and it really speaks for itself. Its development spanned centuries and is still going, expecting to finish in 2026.</p>
                <img src="barcelonatwo.jpg" class="otto">
                <h3>ARC DE TRIOMF</h3>
                <p>The Arc de Triomf is a massive 19th-century arch created by Josep Vilaseca. I was really impressed to see a triumphal arch, and any triumphal arch commemorates a significant event, in this case, French military victories of the Revolutionary and Napoleonic periods. It is striking for its colourful brickwork and Moorish ornamental designs decorated all around.</p>
                <img src="archway.jpg" class="otto">
                <h3>THE GOTHIC QUARTERS</h3>
                <p>The Gothic Quarters seems to be abandoned a Halloween set from a movie but contrary to first sight it is a vibrant and social area of Barcelona. Its medieval style was born in a roman village which in fact makes it an important historical landmark. One of its features was Pont del Bisbe (‘Bishop’s street’), a famous stone bridge decorated with gothic columns and styles.</p>
                <img src="gothic.jpg" class="otto">

            <div>
                <h2>SEVILLE</h2>
                <p>t is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like)</p>

            <div>
                <h2>GRANADA</h2>
                <p>Granada, located south of Spain, is a grand province of monuments. Many students come to Granada to study at Granada University, known for its prestigious rank in Spain, so the population does fluctuate significantly.</p>
                <h3>ALHAMBRA</h3>
                <p>The Alhambra fortress is the most famous monument in Spain, counting about two million tourists per year. It is a prime example of Moorish and Christian culture and art. It was first constructed by the Moors who decidedly invaded Spain’s turf in the 8th century. Their reign eventually ended once the Spanish Catholic Monarchs invaded in 1492.</p>
                <img src="granadaa.webp" class="otto">
                <p>“The Red Castle,” red likely referring to the outer walls of the fortress. The fortress has had a lot of alterations due to being conquered by other groups – both or recking areas in order to infiltrate but also redesigning regions to reflect their cultural preference.</p>
                <img src="fortress.webp" class="otto">
                <p>The features of the castle were gorgeous: gardens, frescoes, columns, arches, and wonderful ornamental designs. Below the palace, there was a hidden network. The tunnels were meant to avoid disturbing sultans but also used soldiers to reside and guard against any potential dangers. The Islamic art was fantastic, my eyes were dazzled by the Nasrid knotwork. Wandering around, I came across the throne room and military zone – dungeons meant for high-profile prisoners.</p>
                <img src="pattern.webp" class="otto">
            </div>




            <div>
                <h2>MIJAS PUEBLO</h2>
                <p>Mijas Pueblo has got to be one of my favourite destinations and is a must if you’re traversing through Malaga. It goes back to Roman times and was referred to as Tarnisa and then Mixa after the Arabs invaded until becoming what we know as Mijas Pueblo once the Spanish reconquered.</p>                
                <img src="mijas4.jpg" class="otto">
                <p>As a result of its popularity among tourists, its once small village and roadless design have evolved to what it is now. The pure white buildings arranged uphill are truly a sight to behold. It is a place for vertical lovers so you will be expecting plenty of stairs to climb up and down. Things that spoke to me include potted plants hanging on the walls, famously tight corners, and amazingly pathed smooth tiles. Local markets and businesses are found practically everywhere, one of them includes the Mijas burro taxis which use donkeys for transport started out in the 1960s. Unfortunately, donkeys are not well suited to holding so many people but are still put through the pain despite injuries.</p>
                <img src="mij.jpg" class="otto">
    
     

                
            </div>

            <div>
                <h2>MALAGA</h2>
                <p>Malaga is the sixth largest city in Spain, located off to the Spanish Mediterranean coast, Costa del Sol. Guess what? this place was the birthplace of Pablo Picasso! Anyways, it is a place dedicated to a crazy number of streets dedicated to shopping and beaches with small food stalls that tag along. Despite what I described as cooler temperatures during fall, this province knows how to keep Spain’s heat from vanishing due to the mountain ranges close by.</p>
                <img src="malaga2.webp" class="otto">
                <p>“Calle Puerta del Mar” was probably the best street and went past which was a lucky find given that Malaga has a maze of narrow streets. Its palms were refreshing when far from the beaches and well easily complements the muted uniform buildings on either side. </p>
                <img src="palmtree.jpeg" class="otto">
                <h3>The Sierra de las Nieves National Park</h3>
                <p>Sierra de las Nieves National Park was a breath of fresh air after the overstimulation of bustling urban cities. Sierra de las Nieves translates to “Mountain Range of the Snows,” yet I didn’t come late enough to see the build-up over the land so here’s a photo one my friends from a few years ago took.</p>
                <img src="snowytree.jpg" class="otto">
                <p>The park has little to no human activity, making it a wonderful place to see a variety of flora but also fauna that you make get a glimpse of if you pay close attention. I for one met a few mountain goats, a common species you’d find there and in fact are one of the largest populations found around the world!</p>
                <img src="park7.webp" class="otto">
                <p>I did face challenges when it came to having a stroll around but that made the experience even better. You may also be inclined to bike, but I wouldn’t risk going rogue and trudging off the built-in paths. If you are like me, stay a little longer through the many village accommodations found nearby.</p>
                <img src="park2.jpg" class="otto">

            <div>
                <h2>MADRID</h2>
                <p>Oh man, Madrid – the capital of Spain. I was expecting this trip to be so blinded by artistic culture, but I guess I should’ve known what I was getting into…</p>
                <p>Both its food and (most importantly to me) street art holds utter vibrancy and an inviting presentation that gets tourists excited.</p>
                <img src="streetart.jpg" class="otto">
                <p>Plaza Mayor lies in the heart of Madrid where many restaurants and cafes lie. The location basked in sun from its centre with many people dwelling there and relaxing. However, it was getting late to see that in action.</p>
                <img src="mandrid.jpg" class="otto">
                <h3>MUSEO NACIONAL DE PRADO</h3>
                <p class="nopad">The Prado Museum, also known as Museo Nacional de Prado, got me really excited. Once we got inside, it was filled to the brim with sculptures, performers, and paintings.</p>
                <p>I was really craving some good ol’ art centuries ago and Spain has yielded many impressive artists. Although I have the urge to talk about the geeky art stuff, I wouldn’t like to get too side-tracked as I do when it comes to my passion. </p>
                <img src="statues.jpg" class="otto">
                <img src="statues2.jpg" class="otto">
                <img src="painters.jpg" class="otto">
                <p>One artist that I was buzzing my mouth about was Goya. What you have not expected was my infatuation not with the paintings but his countless number of sketches, a collection referred to as “Goya’s Los Caprichos” and “Los desastres de la guerra (The Disasters of War),” both packed with around 80 prints. Don’t be fooled by the absurdity of formally clothed donkeys and guitar-wielding monkeys, the meaning behind these prints is dark and corrupted by his time. His etching, 'Gatesca pantomima,' is by far my favourite. </p>
                <img src="goya.jpg" class="otto">
            </div>



            <div>
                <h2>SIDETRACK</h2>
                <h3>FOOD</h3>
                <p>Food for Spain goes back centuries so reasonably their culture largely revolves around it. Its experience in gastronomy has made the country recognised as a leader in culinary. Each location I had travelled to in Spain has a trend in Spanish cuisine.</p>
                <img src="food4.jpg" class="otto">
                <p>I can guarantee that you’ll find fresh foods, pastries, cheese, seafood, wine, and spices. Spain is by far the most iconic when it comes to olive oil producers. You may have even seen their hectares on your way to Spain! I sure have. Inevitably, the Spanish diet is associated with longevity, with the population having an average expectancy of 84 years!</p>
                <img src="food2.jpg" class="otto">
                <p>There are a few things I’d like to get clear when it comes to restaurants. Make sure to get your timing correct as many restaurants won’t be open during certain hours of the day – I had to rely on some snacks I kept in my bag since I was always hungry at the wrong time. What I didn’t see coming were the small portions that are served, unlike what most countries tend to do where larger portions are the go-to.</p>
              
                <img src="meat.jpg " class="otto">
                <h3>CULTURE</h3>
                <p>When it comes to Spain culture, there is a humungous emphasis on the importance of generosity. It is normal for others to encourage sharing food around the table. Don’t be intimidated by eye contact not to mention physical contact even by strangers which is incredibly common. Being touchy is a way to better express themselves but also shows that they are genuine in whatever their motive behind doing so was. For instance, a touch on the back is a good indicator that you’re in someone’s way – people need to go places! The noise level is a sign of comfort and empties those emotions.  In my opinion, it is thrilling to hear so much excitement but even I mistook it for war at first the time I visited a bar.
                    Festivals are so famous in Spain that is have been synonymous with the country’s identity. Sadly, I didn’t come to Spain at the right time as I encountered none. Flamenco and folklore performances are one of my favourite things.
                    </p>

            <div>
                <h2>FINAL THOUGHTS</h2>
                <p>I must reiterate: Spain is a definite go if any of y’all are interested in travelling across countries, both amateur and professional travellers alike! It is rich in, well, everything! I wished I went to more places such as Figueres, home to the Dali Museum, a homage to Salvador Dali. That speaking, I’ll totally come back to Spain to explore places I failed to visit, maybe even extending my trip for more than two weeks.</p>
